In this SQL I answered the following following questions while querying multiple tables

#1 How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> "Order ID";

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = "iPhone"
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> "Order ID";

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers custo
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON custo.order_id = Feb.orderID
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> "Order ID";


#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT product, min(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT product, ROUND(SUM(quantity)*price, 2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY  product;


#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust 
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id 
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2 
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
