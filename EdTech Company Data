## First I need to find the economics courses being taught
SELECT CourseName
FROM Courses 
WHERE Subject='Economics';

## Next, I look for the titles from the  Textboos table  that go with the  economics courses
SELECT CourseName, Title
FROM Courses
JOIN Textbooks
ON Courses.CourseID=Textbooks.CourseID
WHERE Courses.Subject='Economics';

## Last is to find all of the authors along  with the textbook title and the economics course title
  ### AuthorTextbookLink was used because there was no direct link with  the  Courses and Textbooks table
SELECT Courses.CourseName, Textbooks.Title, Author.Name
FROM Courses
JOIN Textbooks
ON Courses.CourseID=Textbooks.CourseID
LEFT JOIN AuthorTextbookLink
ON AuthorTextbookLink.TextbookID=Textbooks.TextbookID
LEFT JOIN Author
ON Author.AuthorID=AuthorTextbookLink.AuthorID
WHERE Courses.Subject='Economics'
ORDER BY 3;
