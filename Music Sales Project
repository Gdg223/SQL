-- I worked with a database that has  different tables relating to album sales, sales employees, customers, and media types. These are some of the questions I answered.

-- What is the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers?
SELECT i.Total,c.FirstName,c.LastName,c.Country, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON c.CustomerID = i.CustomerID
JOIN chinook.employees  e
ON e.EmployeeID = c.SupportRepId;

-- How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*) as 'Total 2009 Invoices'
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like ('2009%');

-- What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total),2) as '2009 Total Sales'
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like ('2009%');

-- Show the purchased track name with each invoice line ID
SELECT t.Name,ii.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items ii
ON t.TrackId = ii.TrackId
ORDER BY 2;

-- Show the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name,ii.InvoiceLineId,artist.name
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items ii
ON t.TrackId = ii.TrackId
JOIN chinook.albums album
ON t.AlbumId = album.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.artists artist
ON album.ArtistId = artist.ArtistId
ORDER BY 2;
