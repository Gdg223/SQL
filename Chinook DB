-- I worked with a database that has  different tables relating to album sales, sales employees, customers, and media types. These are some of the questions I answered.

-- What is the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers?
SELECT i.Total,c.FirstName,c.LastName,c.Country, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON c.CustomerID = i.CustomerID
JOIN chinook.employees  e
ON e.EmployeeID = c.SupportRepId;
